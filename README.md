# Propositional Logic Inference Engine

## Overview

This repository contains an Inference Engine for propositional logic, written entirely in Python. The engine is designed to perform automated reasoning over propositional logic statements and can be used to infer new facts from a given set of premises using various inference algorithms.

## Features

- **100% Python implementation**
- Parsing and representation of propositional statements
- Inference capabilities including methods like Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Resolution, and more
- (Optional) Extensible framework for adding new inference rules

## Getting Started
